## � Founder's Origin Story
> "I started building websites when I became a Virtual Assistant in 2020. Like everyone else, I started with WordPress. I quickly hated it.
>
> I felt boxed in. Customising it kept me up all night. Plugins for SEO, security, themes, it was a bloated mess. I was paying subscriptions for Monday.com, ClickUp, Asana... just to do my job.
>
> So I learned to code. Real code. I built my own internal tools to replace those costs and automate the admin tasks. Now, I run my entire business on custom platforms I built myself. I found my perfect solution, reduced costs by 99%, and I can build yours too."
