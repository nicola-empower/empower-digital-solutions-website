If you sell a premium service, you cannot have a budget website.

It’s a psychological mismatch.

Imagine walking into a luxury hotel and seeing a handwritten sign taped to the door. You immediately trust the brand less. You expect the price to be lower.

## The "Price Anchor"

Your website is the first interaction a client has with your brand. It sets the "Price Anchor."

*   **Generic Template:** Signals "Commodity." Clients will haggle.
*   **Bespoke Experience:** Signals "Expert." Clients expect to pay more.

## Case Study: Cairn Architects

When we built the site for *Cairn Architects*, we didn't just show pictures of houses. We built an immersive experience. We used motion, whitespace, and typography to mirror the quality of their physical work.

The result? They attracted higher-budget clients who valued design, not just square footage.

## Invest in Your Shop Window

Your website is the only salesperson that works 24/7. Dress it for the job you want.
