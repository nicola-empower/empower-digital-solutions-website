Every business starts with a spreadsheet. It's free, it's easy.

But then you grow.

Suddenly, you have `Inventory_Final_v2_REAL.xlsx`. You have three people trying to edit it at once. You have data errors. You have chaos.

## The "Spreadsheet Ceiling"

You hit the ceiling when:
1.  **Version Control:** You don't know which file is the "truth."
2.  **Access:** You can't restrict permissions (e.g., letting staff see stock levels but not costs).
3.  **Mobile:** Have you ever tried to edit a complex Excel sheet on an iPhone?

## The Fix: A Custom Database

We build simple, web-based interfaces that sit on top of your data.

*   **Role-Based Access:** Admin sees everything. Staff sees what they need. Clients see their orders.
*   **Validation:** You can't enter "Banana" in a "Price" field. The system stops errors.
*   **Automation:** When stock hits 0, the system emails the supplier.

Stop fighting your data. Start using it.
