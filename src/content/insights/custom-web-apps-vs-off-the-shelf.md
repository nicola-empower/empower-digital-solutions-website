We live in the golden age of SaaS (Software as a Service). There's an app for everything.

But sometimes, "everything" isn't exactly what *you* need.

## The "Square Peg" Problem

Off-the-shelf software is built for the masses. It has to work for 10,000 different businesses. That means:
*   **Bloat:** You pay for 50 features but only use 3.
*   **Rigidity:** You have to change *your* process to fit *their* software.
*   **Data Silos:** It doesn't talk to your other tools without expensive "Enterprise" plans.

## When to Build Custom

Building your own web app isn't for everyone. But it IS for you if:

1.  **Your "Secret Sauce" is unique:** If your competitive advantage is a specific workflow, don't force it into a generic box.
2.  **You're glued to Spreadsheets:** If your business runs on a fragile Excel sheet that only one person understands, you are one crash away from disaster.
3.  **Subscription Fatigue:** Paying $50/user/month adds up. A custom tool is a one-time asset (CapEx) vs. a forever cost (OpEx).

## The Empower Approach

We build lean, specific tools that do exactly what you need—and nothing you don't. From client portals to inventory trackers, we turn your unique process into a powerful asset.
