Many agencies promise "custom" design but deliver a tweaked template.

Here is what *actual* bespoke design looks like.

## Phase 1: Discovery & Strategy
We don't touch a pixel until we understand your business.
*   **The "Why":** What is the business goal? More leads? Better talent? Investor funding?
*   **The User:** Who are they, and what are they afraid of?

## Phase 2: Wireframing & UX
We build the blueprint. This is about flow, not colors. We map out the user journey to ensure every click has a purpose.

## Phase 3: High-Fidelity Design
This is where the magic happens. We design in Figma, creating a visual language that elevates your brand.
*   **Typography:** Selected for readability and character.
*   **Color Theory:** Chosen to evoke the right emotion (Trust? Excitement? Calm?).

## Phase 4: The Build (Code)
We don't use drag-and-drop builders. We write clean, semantic code (Astro, React, Tailwind).
*   **Performance:** We aim for 100/100 Lighthouse scores.
*   **Accessibility:** Ensuring your site is usable by everyone.

## Phase 5: Launch & Grow
Launch day is just the beginning. We hook up analytics, test forms, and ensure your engine is purring.

This isn't the fast way. It's the right way.
