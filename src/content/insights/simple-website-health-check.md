You check your car's oil. You check your bank balance. But when was the last time you checked your website's health?

A "sick" website leaks traffic. If it's slow, broken, or invisible to Google, you are losing money.

## The 3-Step Checkup

### 1. Speed (The Pulse)
Load your site on your phone on 4G (turn off WiFi).
*   Does it load in under 3 seconds?
*   Does it jump around as it loads? (This is called Cumulative Layout Shift).

### 2. SEO (The Visibility)
Go to Google and type `site:yourdomain.com`.
*   Do your pages show up?
*   Do the titles and descriptions make you want to click?

### 3. Usability (The Joints)
Click every button on your homepage. Fill out your own contact form.
*   Did it work?
*   Did you get the confirmation email?
