You shouldn't have to care about code. But you *should* care about what your business runs on.

We build with a specific set of tools: **Astro, React, Tailwind, and TypeScript.**

Here is why that matters to your bottom line.

## Astro: The Speed Demon
Most websites load a mountain of JavaScript just to show a paragraph of text. Astro strips all that away. It sends pure HTML to the browser.
*   **Benefit:** Your site loads instantly, even on slow 3G phones. Google loves this.

## React: The Interactive Engine
When we need complex interactivity (like a booking calculator or a client dashboard), we use React. It's the same tech Facebook uses.
*   **Benefit:** A smooth, app-like experience that feels premium.

## Tailwind CSS: The Design System
Tailwind allows us to build custom designs rapidly without fighting against "themes."
*   **Benefit:** Your site looks unique, not like a template.

## TypeScript: The Safety Net
TypeScript forces us to write strict code. It catches bugs *before* we launch.
*   **Benefit:** Your site doesn't break randomly on a Tuesday night.

## The Result?
A website that is fast, secure, and built to last for years, not months.
