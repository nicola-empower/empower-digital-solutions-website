Automation sounds scary. It sounds expensive.

But it doesn't have to be. Here are three simple automations you can set up this weekend.

## 1. The "Missed Call" Text
If you miss a client call, have a system automatically text them: *"Sorry I missed you! I'm with a client. How can I help?"*
*   **Why:** It stops them calling your competitor.

## 2. The "Invoice Chaser"
Stop emailing people asking for money. Set up your accounting software (Xero/QuickBooks) to automatically send reminders 3 days before, on the day, and 3 days after the due date.
*   **Why:** You get paid faster without the awkwardness.

## 3. The "Meeting Prep" Email
When someone books a meeting, send them an automated email 24 hours before with the agenda and a "What to bring" list.
*   **Why:** Meetings become shorter and more productive.

## Ready for the Big League?

These are just the basics. If you want to automate your entire client onboarding flow, [let's talk](/contact).
