If you run a service business (salon, clinic, studio), your time is money. Literally.

Every minute you spend texting a client to find a time slot is a minute you aren't earning.

## The "Phone Tag" Tax

Let's do the math.
*   5 mins per booking (emails/texts).
*   20 bookings a week.
*   **= 1.5 hours wasted.**

And that's just the booking. Add in reminders, rescheduling, and deposits, and you're losing 10+ hours a week.

## The Solution: Automated Booking

A custom booking engine (like the one we built for *The Zen Den*) does the heavy lifting:

1.  **Real-Time Availability:** Clients only see slots that are actually free.
2.  **Deposits:** Take payment upfront to stop no-shows.
3.  **Reminders:** Auto-send SMS/Email 24 hours before.
4.  **Intake Forms:** Get medical history/preferences *before* they arrive.
5.  **Rescheduling:** Let them move their own appointment (within your rules).

## "But I like the personal touch"

Your clients don't want to text you. They want to book at 11pm while watching Netflix. Giving them that freedom *is* the ultimate personal touch.
