We run hundreds of website audits every month. The same issues pop up again and again.

Here are the top offenders:

1.  **Huge Images:** Uploading a 5MB photo directly from your camera. (Fix: Compress it to WebP).
2.  **Missing Alt Text:** Google can't "see" images. You need to describe them.
3.  **Broken Links:** Linking to pages that don't exist (404 Errors). It frustrates users and Google hates it.
4.  **Slow Server Response:** Cheap hosting (GoDaddy, Bluehost) is often the bottleneck.
5.  **No Mobile Optimization:** Buttons that are too small for thumbs.
6.  **Duplicate Content:** Copy-pasting text across multiple pages.
7.  **Missing Meta Descriptions:** Leaving the search result snippet blank.

## The Good News

Most of these are easy fixes. You don't need a total rebuild. You just need a tune-up.
