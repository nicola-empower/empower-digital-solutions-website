"The Aesthetic Vault"

I think sometimes people feel like they want to start or redesign their website, but they don't know where to start. I want to create a new section in my website  where people can find inspiration and ideas for their website. but without me creating 50 astro projects and slowing down my computer, plus taking months of my time waiting for react to download onto every project. i think keeping them on my own website rather than sending them off to random vercel urls is a better idea. Keep the current URLs we have already this will become a whole new section. 

This is the hardest part. Staring at a layout designed for "Cyberpunk Chaos" and trying to imagine how to write copy for a Lawyer or a Coffee Shop is jarring.

Here is your **Content Cheat Sheet**. I have broken these down by **Vibe**, and for each vibe, I’ve given you **two distinct "Mock Brands"** to build.

### How to use this rapidly
You don't need to overthink the images.
1.  **Architect:** Use abstract 3D geometry or wireframes.
2.  **Curator:** Use photos of empty rooms or macro shots of texture (stone, skin).
3.  **Titan:** Use shipping containers, skyscrapers, or maps.
4.  **Artisan:** Use hands holding things, coffee cups, or film photography.

If you build **one** of each of these pairs, your "Aesthetic Vault" will look like a massive agency portfolio.
