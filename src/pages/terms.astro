        <strong>6.1 Estimates are not Quotes:</strong> Any indication of time or cost
        provided for hourly work is an estimate only based on the information available
        at the time. The Client will be billed for the actual time spent.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.2 Minimum Charge:</strong> All ad-hoc support requests are subject
        to a minimum charge of 1 hour, regardless of the time taken. Thereafter, time

      <p>
        <strong>6.4 Investigation:</strong> For existing websites not built by Empower
        Digital Solutions (e.g., legacy WordPress sites), we cannot guarantee a fix

        regardless of the outcome.

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7.2 Change Orders:</strong> Any requests for additional features,
        design changes after approval, or functionality outside the original Scope
        of Work will be quoted separately. Work on these additions will not commence
        until the additional cost is agreed upon in writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7.3 Client Delays:</strong> If the project is stalled for more than
        14 days due to the Client failing to provide content, feedback, or assets,
        Empower Digital Solutions reserves the right to invoice for all work completed
        to date and pause the project. A restart fee may apply to resume work.
